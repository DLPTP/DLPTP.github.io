        <h4>The C-test format</h4>
        <p class="text">
          The C-test format, which is based on the principle of reduced redundancy, enables teachers and researchers to
          measure global second language (L2) proficiency. It was first developed in the early 1980s for English and
          German on the basis of the Cloze test, and since then has become one of the most widely used placement test
          formats in higher education due to its high validity and favorable cost-benefit ratio. With more than 500
          publications for many languages, the C-test is also one of the most researched test instruments in language
          testing not just for L2 but also L1 and heritage languages.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          According to the so-called 'Rule of 2-2-2', a C-test consists of 4 to 6 short texts (with either 20 or 25
          gapped words) in which, starting from the second sentence, the second half of every second word is gapped (for
          words consisting of an odd number of letters, half-plus-1 is gapped); the last sentence is also left intact.
          Examinees are required to fill in the gapped part of the words (i.e., reconstruct the original words) based on
          general language knowledge and context knowledge (including grammar, morphology, semantics, and syntax).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          While traditionally a paper-based test format, C-tests are increasingly being administered digitally, with
          gapping, administration, scoring, and feedback all being done automatically.
        </p>
        <p class="example">

          The <a href="https://sifnos.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/cte/" target="_blank">C-Test[<i>editor</i>]</a> is an online
          tool, originally developed by Sabrina Dittrich (neé Galasso) for English, French, Italian,
          and Spanish as part of a Master thesis in Computational Linguistics in 2016 and extended for other languages
          throughout 2021-present by various team members in the DLPTP project. This tool allows users to automatically
          generate C-test testlets from user-provided texts with optional language-specific considerations.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The currently available languages in the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] are: Arabic,
          Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish.

                Teaching and learning Arabic as a foreign language can be supported with the use of effective digital
                assessment tools. An Arabic extension to the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] has been added in order to facilitate
                the
                automatic generation of C-tests for assessing learners' Arabic while taking into account a range of
                language-specific features. This project comprises a Master thesis in Computational Linguistics in
                collaboration with LEAD, the Department of Oriental and Islamic Studies (Abteilung für Orient-
                und Islamwissenschaft), the Center for Islamic Theology (ZITh), and the Department of Oriental and Islamic
                Studies (Abteilung für Orient- und Islamwissenschaft) at the University of Tübingen as well as Humboldt
                University of Berlin and University of Würzburg. Additionally, an Arabic group has been formed for the
                development of C-tests which consists of academics from Tübingen and other universities.
              </p>
              <h4>C-Test[<i>editor</i>]</h4>
              <p class="text">
                The Arabic option of the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] includes a variety of language-specific features which
                address some linguistic challenges. The user is able to choose whether or not they would like to:
              <ul class="text-list text">
                <li>include or exclude diacritics</li>
                <li>exclude the definite article (ال) from gapping (it is always connected to the word as a prefix, which
                  may lead to invalid gapping as the article is sometimes equal in length to half of the length of the
                  word to which they are connected, which results in incorrectly gapping the actual lexical item</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Since Arabic is a highly inflectional language, a section is included in the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] which
                displays the stem of each gapped word.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Additional linguistic features are also included in the C-Test[<i>editor</i>], such as some linguistic
                complexity
                and readability metrics, as well as an overview of the number of verbs, adjectives, relative pronouns,
                etc. which can aid in measuring the difficulty of the text.

                Chinese is one of the most learned languages in the world, so an effective Chinese proficiency testing
                tool such as the C-test is beneficial to both learners and teachers in helping identify learners' language
                proficiency levels. For learners, this means that they can self-assess their language proficiency and
                receive a recommendation for a course suitable to their individual proficiency level; for teachers this
                means the possibility to form homogeneous language groups. However, at the present moment little research
                in this field has been done on non-European languages such as Mandarin Chinese. The C-Test[<i>editor</i>]
                has
                therefore been extended to also include Chinese in order to further research in this challenging area. A
                Chinese group has been formed for C-test development which consists of academics from the University of
                Tübingen and other universities. This group aims to meet the technical language-specific prerequisites for
                an automated placement test and discuss conceptual issues, including user-specific questions.
              </p>
              <h4>C-Test[<i>editor</i>]</h4>
              <p class="text">
                The C-Test[<i>editor</i>] has been extended to include the automatic generation of C-tests in Chinese. The
                Chinese option provides users with language-specific settings, including:
              <ul class="text-list text">
                <li>choosing whether or not to generate the test in simplified or traditional characters</li>
                <li>displaying testlets with or without Pinyin</li>
                <li>selecting how many characters a gap should comprise</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Furthermore, users are provided with some linguistic complexity and readability analysis statistics for
                each user-provided text, which are useful for the evaluation of the difficulty level of the text. Users
                can also see various statistics pertaining to the text, such as the number of lexical or grammatical
                items, repetitions, etc.
              </p>
              <h4>Language exercises</h4>
              <p class="text">
                There are currently plans to develop language learning exercises with detailed and automated feedback for
                learners of Chinese who want to keep track on their learning progress.

                The need for teaching German as foreign language in a university context is growing steadily, both within
                German-speaking countries and abroad. This requires a means of adequately assessing learners' language
                skills by means of a placement test, as well as designing lessons and individual learning units according
                to individual language levels. These lessons, where applicable or necessary, can be offered digitally with
                automated feedback.
              </p>
              <h4>C-Test[<i>editor</i>]</h4>
              <p class="text">
                C-tests have long been proven to be very reliable and meaningful as a placement test format at the
                university level. In order to facilitate digitalisation of language learning and teaching, the
                C-Test[<i>editor</i>] has now been extended to include German as part of the C-test project at the
                University of Tübingen, in cooperation with other universities. The C-test[<i>editor</i>] for German
                currently enables users to automatically gap the second half of every second word, according to the C-test
                principle, and to export the gapped text. In development are also options for language-specific
                characteristics of German, such as the productive occurrence of multi-part compound nouns. Since a clear
                reconstruction is not to be expected here, an option will be provided to gap the entire compound as a
                single word or gap the components separately. The C-Test[<i>editor</i>] interface also provides additional
                information about the generated testlet, such as the type or frequency of the gapped words. Furthermore,
                the interface provides some basic statistics on the linguistic complexity and readability, such as the
                Type-Token Ratio of the text. This facilitates the selection of suitable texts for the creation of
                testlets.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Automated placement testing is also planned for German as a second language (i.e., German taught in
                Germany as a foreign language). The concepts and format required for this are currently in development.
              </p>
              <h4>Language exercises</h4>
              <p class="text">
                Finally, an additional platform linked to the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] is being developed in parallel. This
                platform is planned to host digitalised language exercises for learners of German which will give learners
                individual feedback (correct/incorrect answers, as well as more detailed hints to guide learners to the
                correct answers) and provide teachers with the opportunity to choose between different exercise formats,
                proficiency levels, and language-specific options.

                Italian has been implemented in the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] from the beginning, so most of the work lies in

                electronically at the Foreign Language Center (FSZ) at the University Tübingen, yielding a large
                collection of results for comparison. Currently, the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] offers a wide selection of text
                statistics for Italian, such as an overview of the number of nouns, verbs, repeated gaps, etc. in the
                text.

              <p class="text">
                C-tests in Italian have also been implemented as placement tests at the Department of Romance Languages at
                the University of Tübingen via the Ilias platform. An automated analysis on the results of the placement
                tests was performed, which allowed for easily visualising testlet-level and broader test-level statistics.

                In teaching Russian as a foreign language, there exists the need for a tool which can automatically
                generate a valid digital placement test for learners. As the C-test format for Russian is still relatively
                rare, the conceptual approach for C-tests in Russian was developed as part of the C-test project in
                collaboration with LEAD and the Department of Slavic Studies. Starting in 2021, digital C-tests offered
                via the Ilias platform are in use as placement tests for Russian courses at the Department of Slavic
                Studies, with an automated analysis able to be generated for the results in order to allow for the easy
                visualisation of testlet-level and broader test-level statistics.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Additionally, there is a currently on-going Russian validation project in which C-tests are being offered
                to learners and teachers from universities all over Germany in order to collect data on Russian C-tests
                and further research in this field. This project includes not only C-tests for foreign language learners,
                but additionally a tailored Cloze test targeted at heritage speakers.

              <p class="text">
                Along with the C-test itself, the C-Test[<i>editor</i>] also provides users with some linguistic
                complexity and readability measures such various type-token ratios in order to help determine the
                difficulty level of a text and its appropriateness for foreign language learners and heritage speakers at
                various proficiency levels. The tool also offers a variety of text statistics, such as gap length, types
                of gapped words, etc., in order to factor in different teaching and learning needs (e.g., assisting
                language teachers in quickly and efficiently determining different levels of competence in Russian).
